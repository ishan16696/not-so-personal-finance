# Not so personal finance

I named it as `not-so-personal-finance` as our financial planning is lot depends and influence by external factors of global economic landscape. To make financial planning less personal and more universal, I'm sharing this as a starting point for others to form their own plan, and also to gather feedback on what we can improve. If you have a suggestion, feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/ishan16696/not-so-personal-finance/issues).
